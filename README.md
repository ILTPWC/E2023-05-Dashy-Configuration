# ILTPWC - My Dashy Configuration

Hey guys in this repository you will find my dashy dashboard configuration as well as my traefik and docker-compose config to setup dashy with SSL certificates with letsencrypt.

The configuration belongs to the following YouTube Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBnMGrHROBg

In order to run the docker-compose file you need to adjust the traefik configuration first and replace the <VARIABLES> with your credentials.

After that just use docker-compose up -d to the services on your docker host (-d is to detach the script from your shell so that in runs in background)
